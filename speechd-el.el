;;; Commentary:
;;
;; speechd-el is an Emacs client to speech synthesizers, Braille
;; displays and other alternative output interfaces.  It provides full
;; speech and Braille output environment for Emacs.

;; It is aimed primarily at visually impaired users who need
;; non-visual communication with Emacs, but it can be used by anybody
;; who needs sophisticated speech or other kind of alternative output
;; from Emacs.  speechd-el can make Emacs a completely speech and
;; BRLTTY enabled application suitable for visually impaired users or,
;; depending on its configuration, it can only speak in certain
;; situations or when asked, to serve needs of any Emacs user.
